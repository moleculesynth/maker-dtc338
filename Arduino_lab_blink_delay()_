/*
  This is the example sketch that we used in our first Workshop, 
  was a lesson in using the delay() function.
  
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second (1000 milliseconds), then off for one second, repeatedly.
 
  This example code is in the public domain.

// in the first part of our sketch we identify, intialize, and name
// the variables we will use.
// Let's use pin 13, since it has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// So, we could just use the number 13 in our simple sketch (we only need it in one function, digitalWrite()), 
// but in other cases, we might be calling and reading that pin in several parts of the program,
// so we create a name for it that we can use without confusing the pin for an integer. 
// the pin's name could be anything, but best practice for this is to use an identifying name that is 
// easy to understand and easy to remember:

int led = 13;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset


void setup() {                
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);     
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again -- try changing the delay() functions and see what happens
// notice that we are using digitalWrite here.  we will try using digitalRead in another sketch.
// 
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
