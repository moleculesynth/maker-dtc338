This project began while discussing with Justin Williams that it is possible to make the Processing (Processing.org) and Arduino programs "talk" with one another. With this in mind I began by following the tutorial found on https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing. With this code the mouse or mouse pad serves as the switch by changing values on the serial port when clicked. I made a few tweaks in processing by printing out my own custom canvas on the screen. Once I had one led working I thought it would be fun to make two leds swap on/off at different serial values. I successfully made two leds alternate turning on and off, see the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-92X6yAabw. 

By using these two programs together, one could easily make an interactive art exhibit. One might make a game that has leds to serve as cues (green, yellow, red) or play sounds through the arduino. From this process I have learned how to make two programs communicate and change on/off values.
