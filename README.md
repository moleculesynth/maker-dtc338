# DTC 338, Spring 2015: “Maker Culture: Design at the Intersection of Material and Digital Practice” 

This course is an undergraduate-level hands-on introduction to Maker Culture. It is a makers’ workshop, a design lab, and a creative-programming studio, intended to provide a supporting framework for students’ research and development as they build ambitious projects of their own design.  This class will generate a shared research dialogue and space within which to pursue creative work that is conceptual and technical, and it is preeminently a place for students to ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas.  Course meetings will consist of a combination of roundtable discussions, reflective writing, group “critiques,” 5-minute presentations, design thinking exercises, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops.

	* WEEKLY WORKSHOP CHALLENGES: In-class design and building challenges
	* TWO PRESENTATIONS: Medium/Slideshare/Prezi/Tumblr/Wordpress post and in-class quick presentation on select projects or concepts of “Maker Culture”
	* TWO PROTOTYPES: Designing, documenting and building your own Maker Projects (Robot/Microcontroller, Wearable/IoT, 3D Printed/Digitally Fabricated)
	* FINAL PROJECT: Creating a full “Instructables”-like How-To Demonstration for your own original Maker Project

## Requirements and Assessment 
### Grades will be based on the following:

### Additionally, satisfying the requirements of this class means: 
	* All reading/video/audio assignments completed on time and as assigned.
	* You are required to participate in the daily activities of our class — because we are learning in “workshop” mode, your presence in class, on time, every meeting is crucial.
	* Independent research projects should be completed with originality and an effort made to share learning with the rest of the class.
	* Students are expected to push themselves utilizing what is learned and what is already known in ways that are new, useful, and interesting to themselves, the class, and to the world.

### Notes, Key Terms, Examples
* What is Circuit Bending? 
	* "Circuit bending is one of the most interesting forms of tinkering. It’s the
	creative short-circuiting of low-voltage, battery-powered electronic audio
	devices such as guitar effect pedals, children’s toys, and small synthesizers
	to create new musical instruments and sound generators. The heart
	of this process is the 'art of chance.'" -Massimo Banzi, Getting Started with Arduino (2011.10)

### Homework
Upload photos and details in a short step-by-step write-up of how you did a circuit bend or break out: keep in mind DETAILS matter and will be of significant interest to everyone, so please show-and-tell your circuit bend in all of its developmental stages.  Also, you might want to search around for other circuit bends -- you might find that someone else has done some incredible things with the toy or instrument that you are working on, and if nothing else, seeing more circuit bends will give you new things to consider while creating your own.

## Week 4: February 6 – Workshop#4: Back to Arduino & Programming Response, Resistance is Futile!

Our second Arduino workshop will be a challenge to find interesting ways of integrating buttons, switches, potentiometers, and photo sensors into our projects -- get ready, we're launching into the world of designing physical interfaces, embedded programs and interactivity!

### Homework
* Write and post your own Arduino or Processing sketch, describe either in comments or in a separate txt file (1) what you started with, (2) what you experienced, (3) what you changed, (4) what you experienced after changes were made, (5) what you ended up with, and (6) what you think this project might lead to for you or others (what ELSE could be done with this?).

## Week 5: February 13 – Workshop#5A: Programming Response, Viva la Resistance!

Today we come back to Arduinos, building upon what we have already done.  We have made blinky LEDs, integrated buttons and potentiometers, and now let's see if we make devices that perform multiple functions from multiple inputs.  Bonus points for connecting more than one Arduino board in your project! 

N.B. In addition to our regular activities in the next two classes, we will make time to work on or address questions concering your first Prototype assignment, which is due in class on February 27.

### Homework
* Email to the Class Google Group a full project proposal for your Prototype - you might include any sketches, diagrams, schematics, code / sample code, videos or photos that have helped your thinking develop on this.  This is an opportunity to collect your ideas on this, brainstorm a bit, state the "problem" your project is addressing or solving, and start thinking about possible refinements or iterative variants you'll be exploring.  Include the following in the subject line: "Prototype#1 Proposal: [Title and your name]"  -- Due before class on February 20.

## Week 6: February 20 – Workshop#5B: Programming Response, ‘I, Robot’!

Today's workshop will focus on creating an autonomous device. Let's see if we can build something with our Arduinos that operates on its own.  Is it "deciding" to do things? Is it "behaving" in its own way?  Do our independently operating Arduinos drift into dreams of electric sheep?
