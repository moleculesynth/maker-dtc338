# DTC 338, Spring 2015: “Maker Culture: Design at the Intersection of Material and Digital Practice” 

This course is an undergraduate-level hands-on introduction to Maker Culture. It is a makers’ workshop, a design lab, and a creative-programming studio, intended to provide a supporting framework for students’ research and development as they build ambitious projects of their own design.  This class will generate a shared research dialogue and space within which to pursue creative work that is conceptual and technical, and it is preeminently a place for students to ask questions, seek guidance and exchange ideas.  Course meetings will consist of a combination of roundtable discussions, reflective writing, group “critiques,” 5-minute presentations, design thinking exercises, and focused topic-and-tool-specific workshops.

### Notes, Key Terms, Examples
* What is Circuit Bending? 
	* "Circuit bending is one of the most interesting forms of tinkering. It’s the
	creative short-circuiting of low-voltage, battery-powered electronic audio
	devices such as guitar effect pedals, children’s toys, and small synthesizers
	to create new musical instruments and sound generators. The heart
	of this process is the 'art of chance.'" -Massimo Banzi, Getting Started with Arduino (2011.10)

### Homework
Upload photos and details in a short step-by-step write-up of how you did a circuit bend or break out: keep in mind DETAILS matter and will be of significant interest to everyone, so please show-and-tell your circuit bend in all of its developmental stages.  Also, you might want to search around for other circuit bends -- you might find that someone else has done some incredible things with the toy or instrument that you are working on, and if nothing else, seeing more circuit bends will give you new things to consider while creating your own.

## Week 4: February 6 – Workshop#4: Back to Arduino & Programming Response, Resistance is Futile!

Our second Arduino workshop will be a challenge to find interesting ways of integrating buttons, switches, potentiometers, and photo sensors into our projects -- get ready, we're launching into the world of designing physical interfaces, embedded programs and interactivity!

## Week 6: February 20 – Workshop#5B: Programming Response, ‘I, Robot’!

Today's workshop will focus on creating an autonomous device. Let's see if we can build something with our Arduinos that operates on its own.  Is it "deciding" to do things? Is it "behaving" in its own way?  Do our independently operating Arduinos drift into dreams of electric sheep?

## Week 8: March 6 – Workshop#6: Breadboarding a CMOS Synth with an CD4093 Quad NAND Gate 

Today we will use our breadboards to build a sound generator from an IC, a CD4093 Quad NAND Gate, with another IC for the amplifier, the LM386 Op-Amp.  This is a classic DIY electronics project from which many creative vairants have been made by circuit heads and synth builders.  The idea is to start with a simple version of a noise-maker and then experiement with different capacitor and resistor values, trying out your own configurations to create your own instrument!  In addition to momentary buttons (switches) and turn knobs (potentiometers) that we have worked with before, we'll also have two physical sensors that will allow for non-conventional control over your synth creations: photocells and pressure sensors.

## Week 13: April 17 – Prototype#2 A Working Model of Your Final Project: Pitch Day!

Today we will focus on the concept and goal of your final project -- everyone presents a lightning-flash version of their project with two main goals: (1) to refine your idea and what is distinctive about it, and (2) to get feedback and "crowdsourced" or community response.  

This is a day to make your "elevator pitch," and you will tell the story of your project, including answers to the following questions:  
	* what is the project?  
	* who else will be interested in this project? 
	* what do you think it will do? 
	* what do you think will distinguish your version from other versions of this project? 
	* what do you expect will be challenging about completing this project? 
	* what strategies do you have to meet those challenges?  
Also, feel free to ask the class for feedback and help.  
We will use the entire day for information gathering, so plan ahead, practice your elevator pitch, anticipate what you'd like to talk about and use this class time wisely!  

## Week 14: April 24 – Workshop#9: Design for Manufacturing: Putting it all together

Today we will create a bill of materials, work with online ordering, practice reaching out manufacturers, look at an Eagle-CAD electronic circuit design and submit it to an online PCB manufacturer -- all of this will give you an experience of how to move your project from your workshop into the world of manufacturing.  We will also spend time finishing 3D prints, fine-tuning the electrical designs and code of your own final projects, and there will be time for questions.  We will be working together in groups for part of the class, and there will be class time for working on your Final Project.
